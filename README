DESCRIPTION

ush is a command interpreter with a syntax similar to UNIX C shell, csh(1). However, it is for instructional purposes only, therefore it is much simpler. 

Initialization and Termination:
When first stared, ush normally performs commands from the file Ìƒ/.ushrc, provided that it is readable. Commands in this file are processed just the same as if they were taken from standard input. 

Interactive Operation:
After startup processing, an interactive ush shell begins reading commands from the terminal, prompting with hostname%. The shell then repeatedly performs the following actions: a line of command input is read and broken into words; this sequence of words is parsed (as described under Usage); and the shell executes each command in the current line.
